# Product of other elements
Imagine that you are given an array of integers. For example `[1, 2, 3 , 4, 5]`. 

What you are asked to do is to write a function that for all numbers in that array computes product of all integers in the array except for the number at that particular position.

So our example array of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` should produce: `[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]`. 

Obvious solution involves division. What if we want to do another iteration and solve this exercise without using division?
